Installation
============

Requirements
------------

``roboglia`` requires Python 3. The CI builds test the package with:

- Python 3.6 and 3.7
- OS: Linux; distributions Xenial (16.04) and Bionic (18.04)
- Architecture: AMD64 and ARM64

This doesnâ€™t mean the package might not work on other OS / Architecture /
Python version combinations, but they are not officially supported.

Due to the heavily hardware dependent nature of ``roboglia`` some of the
functionality requires lower level modules to communicate with the physical
devices. For example to use Dynamixel devices you need ``dynamixel_sdk``
module, for I2C devices ``smbus2``, for SPI devices ``spidev``, etc. These
packages are not available for all platforms and Python version, so care
must be taken when deciding what platform to use for the robot.

While the package includes these functionalities, we are aware that not all
robots will need to use all these types of devices. For instance, a robot
might use only PWM controlled devices accessed through an I2C multiplexer
like this `16 Channel PWM Bonnet`_ from Adafruit. There is therefore no need
to install ``dynamixel_sdk`` or ``spidev``.

With this observation in mind we have decided not to explicitly include hard
dependencies on these low level packages. This means that when you install
``roboglia`` it will not automatically install them for you. It will also
not check if they are available, instead it will be your responsibility to
install the dependencies as you need them, as explained in the next
paragraphs. This is an important point to remember, so here it is emphasized
in a warning:

.. warning:: ``roboglia`` does not automatically install dependent packages
    for hardware access. You will have to install them manually as your 
    robot requires.

Installation procedure
----------------------

You can install roboglia without installing the hardware dependencies, but 
when you will use it you must have those dependencies available otherwise 
Python will raise an ``No module`` exception.

You can install roboglia using pip::

    pip install roboglia

This will work well, and is especially recommended, for `conda`_ environments.
This will install only the main package without hardware package dependencies,
but with other dependencies (like PyYAML).

If you want to install a particular version of the package you can specify::

    pip install roboglia==X.X.X

If you want to install the latest code from Github, you can clone it and 
install it from there::

    cd /tmp
    git clone https://github.com/sonelu/roboglia.git
    cd roboglia
    [sudo] python setup.py install

The last command might require you to enter the password to allow sudo elevation.

Installing hardware dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The installer comes with a number of configurations for extra packages that 
can be installed as needed.

`dynamixel_sdk`_ is released and maintained by ROBOTIS, the maker of the 
Dynamixel ecosystem. For more details about the package and up to date 
information and installation instructions visit the `DynamixelSDK Manual`_
on ROBOTIS website.

To install dynamixel_sdk when you install roboglia you specify::

    pip install roboglia[dynamixel]

.. warning:: ``dynamixel_sdk`` is itself dependent on ``pyserial`` and will
    attempt to install it. Not all platforms have support for pyserial.

If you plan to use I2C devices in your robot, then you need to install 
``smbus2``::

    pip install roboglia[i2c]

For more details about the package and up to date information and installation 
instructions visit the `smbus2 Github`_ page.

.. warning:: Not all platforms have support for smbus2.

If you plan to use SPI devices in your robot, then you need to install 
``spidev``::

    pip install roboglia[spi]

For more details about the package and up to date information and installation 
instructions visit the `spidev Github`_ page.

.. warning:: Not all platforms have support for spidev.

If you intend to use a combination of hardware you can install them by entering 
the codes above separated by comas, for instance if you need Dynamixel and I2C 
you would use::

    pip install roboglia[dynamixel,i2c]

.. warning:: The pip syntax requires there are no blanks between the elements 
    in the square brackets above.

To simplify things, if you need all communication packages, there is an option 
``all`` that will install all the **extra** dependencies::

    pip install roboglia[all]

.. note:: This option will be kept in line with future developments and, if 
    new hardware dependencies will be added, will be updated to include them. 
    So you can be assured that this installation option will install all extra 
    dependencies in addition to the core dependencies.
