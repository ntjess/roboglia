``base`` Module
===============

.. automodule:: roboglia.base

Classes in ``roboglia`` can be categorized in two groups in relation to their
position to the main robot class:

* **Downstream** classes: are classes that are located between the robot class 
  and the physical devices.

* **Upstream** classes are classes that expose the robot capabilities in a 
  uniform way like 'joints', 'sensors', 'moves', etc.
   
**Downstream**

The following classes from ``base`` module are provided for representing
various structural elements of a robot.
