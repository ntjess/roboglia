class Joint():
    """A Joint is a convenient class to represent a positional device.

    A Joint class provides an abstract access to a device providing:

    - access to arbitrary registers in device to retrieve / set the position
    - possibility to invert coordinates
    - possibility to add an offset so that the 0 of the joint is different
      from the 0 of the device
    - include max and min range in joint coordinates to reflect physical
      limitation of the joint

    Parameters
    ----------
    init_dict: dict
        The dictionary used to initialize the joint.

        The following keys are exepcted in the dictionary:

        - ``name``: the name of the joint
        - ``device``: the device object connected to the joint
        - ``pos_read``: the register name used to retrieve from the
          device the position
        - ``pos_write``: the register name used to write to the device
          the desired position
        - ``activate``: the register name used to change the activation
          of the device
        
        The following keys are optional and can be omitted. They will be
        defaulted with the values mentioned bellow:

        - ``inverse``: ``True`` or ``False``, indicates that a joint has
          inverse coordinate system versus the device (ex. if the device
          moves counter-clockwise the joint will be clockwise); defaults
          to ``False``
        - ``offset``: represents an offset in the units used by the 
          device registers between the joint's 0 and device's 0; the
          offset is added **after** the impact of ``inverse``; defaults
          to 0
        - ``min``: introduces a minimum limit for the joint value; the
          limit is applied in joint coordinates (after ``offset`` and 
          ``inverse``); defaults to ``None`` which means no minimum is
          applied
        - ``max``: introduces a maximum limit for the joint value; the
          limit is applied in joint coordinates (after ``offset`` and 
          ``inverse``); defaults to ``None`` which means no maximum is
          applied
        
        ``min`` and ``max`` are used only when writing values to device.
        You can use both, only one of them or none.
